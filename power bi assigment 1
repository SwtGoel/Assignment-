    "Answer All reports you build in Power BI Desktop are published on the Power BI Service cloud platform. Users can use client platforms, including websites, mobile devices, etc., to view the reports and dashboards from the Power BI Service. As a result, each client wishing to access content generated by Power BI must engage with the Power BI Service. Therefore, we must examine the inner workings of Power BI Service to understand how it functions. \n",
